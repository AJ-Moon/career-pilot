      "answer": "Choose a concept you deeply understand, such as gradient boosting or A/B testing, and explain it in simple, clear terms. For example, 'Gradient boosting is an ensemble method that combines many weak decision trees to create a strong predictive model by iteratively correcting the errors of previous trees.'"

      "question": "How would you explain an A/B test to an engineer with no statistics background? A linear regression?",
      "answer": "A/B testing compares two versions of something (like a webpage) to see which performs better by randomly splitting users into groups and measuring outcomes. A linear regression finds the best-fitting line that predicts a numeric outcome based on input variables."

    {
      "category": "Communication",
      "question": "How would you explain a confidence interval to an engineer with no statistics background? What does 95% confidence mean?",
      "answer": "A 95% confidence interval gives a range of values that, if we repeated the experiment many times, would contain the true value 95% of the time. It reflects uncertainty in estimation, not the probability that the true value lies in that specific range."

        "question": "(Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.",
        "answer": "Start with simple models (e.g., linear or logistic regression), perform feature engineering, and validate performance using cross-validation. Split data into training, validation, and test sets. Favor simple, interpretable models before moving to more complex ones like tree ensembles."

        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data?",
        "answer": "The model might perform poorly on test data due to dataset shift. This can happen if P(x) or P(y|x) changes over time. Use domain adaptation techniques, retraining, or covariate shift correction to improve generalization."

      {
        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "What are some ways I can make my model more robust to outliers?",
        "answer": "Use robust loss functions such as MAE or Huber loss, tree-based models, or data transformations (like log). You can also Winsorize or remove extreme values if they’re truly anomalies."

        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "What are some differences you would expect in a model that minimizes squared error versus a model that minimizes absolute error?",
        "answer": "Minimizing squared error (MSE) penalizes large errors heavily, making it sensitive to outliers. Minimizing absolute error (MAE) treats all errors equally, making it more robust. MSE is easier to optimize; MAE is preferred when outliers are expected."

        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "What error metric would you use to evaluate how good a binary classifier is? What if the classes are imbalanced? What if there are more than two groups?",
        "answer": "Use accuracy for balanced classes. For imbalanced data, prefer AUC-ROC, F1-score, or precision-recall curves. For multi-class problems, extend metrics like log loss or use macro/micro-averaged F1."

        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "What is regularization and where might it be helpful?",
        "answer": "Regularization (L1, L2) penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. L1 (Lasso) encourages sparsity; L2 (Ridge) reduces variance by shrinking weights."

      {
        "category": "Predictive Modeling",
        "question": "Why might it be preferable to include fewer predictors rather than many?",
        "answer": "Too many predictors increase model complexity, risk overfitting, and reduce interpretability. Fewer predictors improve generalization and computation efficiency, especially with limited data."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "What is R²? What are some other metrics that could be better than R² and why?",
      "answer": "R² measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. It always increases with more predictors, so use adjusted R² to account for degrees of freedom. For prediction, use RMSE, MAE, or cross-validated error instead."

    {
      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "What is the curse of dimensionality?",
      "answer": "As the number of features grows, data becomes sparse and distances between points become less meaningful. This hurts clustering, prediction, and generalization. Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) or feature selection helps mitigate this."
    },
    {
      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "Is more data always better?",
      "answer": "Not always. More data helps only if it’s high-quality and relevant. Biased or noisy data can harm models. Also, more data increases storage, compute cost, and time. Focus on data quality and feature engineering first."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "What are advantages of plotting your data before performing analysis?",
      "answer": "1) Identify errors or outliers (e.g., unrealistic values). 2) Detect skewness or multimodality. 3) Understand relationships and trends. Visualization guides better model and feature choices."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "What is the role of trial and error in data analysis? What is the role of making a hypothesis before diving in?",
      "answer": "Trial and error helps discover unexpected insights, while hypotheses give focus and prevent overfitting. Combine both — iterate between exploring patterns and testing hypotheses scientifically."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "How do you deal with some of your predictors being missing?",
      "answer": "Options: 1) Drop rows if missingness is random and limited. 2) Impute with mean, median, or model-based predictions. 3) Use algorithms like Random Forests that handle missing values natively."

      "question": "You have several variables positively correlated with your response, but one predictor has a negative weight in regression. What could be the issue?",
      "answer": "Likely multicollinearity — predictors are highly correlated, leading to unstable coefficients. Use variance inflation factor (VIF), drop correlated variables, or apply PCA or regularization."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "Now you have a feasible number of predictors, but you’re fairly sure that you don’t need all of them. How would you perform feature selection?",
      "answer": "Apply Lasso (L1) or Elastic Net regularization, univariate statistical tests, or recursive feature elimination (RFE). Keep only features that improve cross-validated performance."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "Your linear regression didn’t run and reports infinite solutions for coefficients. What could be wrong?",
      "answer": "Perfect multicollinearity or more predictors than observations (p > n). Remove redundant features or use regularization (Ridge/Lasso)."

      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "You run your regression on subsets of data and see that the beta for a variable varies wildly. What could be the issue?",

    {
      "category": "Data Analysis",
      "question": "What is the main idea behind ensemble learning?",
      "answer": "Combine multiple weak models to form a stronger one. Bagging reduces variance, boosting reduces bias, and stacking blends diverse models using meta-learning. Usually performs better than a single model."
